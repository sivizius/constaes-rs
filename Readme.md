constaes-rs
===========

This can be used to encrypt data at compile time.
Well, at least, I hope so.
This needs nightly!
```
cargo +nightly run
```

The encrypted constant `myCipher` can be found in the release version, because it is used by print.
I did not find the other constants `myKey` and `myPlain` in the release version.
Thats good.
I guess, because they are not used.
